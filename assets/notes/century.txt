Old Leather-Bound Notebook
June 16, 192{X} - I have been commissioned to construct a new clock tower for the city. This is an exciting opportunity. The tower itself I shall outsource to a local construction company. The clock that will live within the tower is my main focus. The ongoing maintenance of a clock is surely one of the most difficult things for a city to do. My plan, then, is to create an intelligent clock that can self-maintain, lasting 100 years without requiring human intervention. I shall call it Century.
September 5, 192{X} - The bureaucrats at City Hall have sent me many missives asking when the empty tower will be filled. Those fools should know not to rush genius.
November 1, 192{X} - The city has stolen my construction contract and has given it to another. This betrayal will not go unrepaid... I shall move into the empty clock tower and make it my home, as revenge against the city that spited me.
